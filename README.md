# Music Generation - End-to-End

This project provides an end-to-end solution for generating music using machine learning. It covers the full pipeline from data preprocessing, model training, and generating music sequences. The project utilizes deep learning techniques (such as Long Short-Term Memory networks, or LSTM) to generate music based on input data such as MIDI files.

## Overview

The **Music Generation - End-to-End** project implements a machine learning solution for generating music. The core of the project is built around the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - MIDI files are converted to a sequence of notes and other musical elements (like timing, velocity) suitable for training the model.
   
2. **Model Training**:
   - The preprocessed data is used to train an LSTM-based model. The LSTM network is capable of learning temporal dependencies in musical sequences and generating new compositions.

3. **Music Generation**:
   - Once trained, the model is used to generate music sequences that can be converted back into MIDI format and played on compatible software or instruments.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Converts raw MIDI files into a suitable format for model training, extracting note sequences, timing information, and pitch.

- **LSTM Model**:
  - Uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to model the temporal relationships between musical notes, generating realistic music based on learned patterns.

- **Music Generation**:
  - Generates new music sequences from the trained model and saves them as MIDI files.

- **Visualization**:
  - Includes visualizations to understand the learning process and evaluate the generated music using techniques such as spectrograms or note heatmaps.

- **Evaluation**:
  - Evaluates the quality of generated music using specific metrics such as sequence diversity or similarity to human-created compositions.
